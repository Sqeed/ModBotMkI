# ModBotMkI
The old ModBot

This is the repository for the old ModBot aka ModBotMkI. I created this bot while learning the Discord.net library and while refreshing my C# knowledge. This means that the code in here is quite sloppy and sometimes inefficient. I am intending to rewrite the bot in Discord.net 1.0 which means that everything we will keep from this code are the names of most of the commands and what most of them do.
